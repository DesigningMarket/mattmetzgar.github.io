I"<p>What did people do with their free time before the internet? That’s the question from an interesting new <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444817737296?casa_token=D5_3WFoSim4AAAAA:o7h34nKjvsAZSqxP3qW-xYHYLH7p6qilmAOM7W_FFGt4yvtprWHSG5Xwkt9fBcp6wpKh4QxEtAn5Gw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> I came across. It tracked time use for young adults across three different decades.</p>

<p>Some of the results were predictable, such as less reading of books and newspapers. The results also showed there were less in-person visits. Most likely, this is due to the ability to connect with people online.</p>

<p>What interested me the most was the change in non-electronic hobbies. There was a sharp decline.</p>

<p>I’ve wondered about this for some time. With the constant availability of the internet, are young people still engaging in offline hobbies, such as musical instruments and art?</p>

<p>On average, it appears the answer is no.</p>

<p>Non-electronic hobbies such as art and music have a long <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26733272/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history</a> of enhancing well-being. Engaging in these offline activities would most likely improve health more than additional screen time.</p>

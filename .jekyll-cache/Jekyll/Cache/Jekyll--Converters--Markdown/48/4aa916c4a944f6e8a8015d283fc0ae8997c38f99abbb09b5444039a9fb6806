I"<p>I’m reading an interesting <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Reading-News-Manifesto-Happier/dp/1529342724/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a>, “Stop Reading The News” by Rolf Dobelli.</p>

<p>The book makes a number of persuasive arguments why people should stop reading the news on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The book also challenges readers to go 30 days without news to break the habit. I’m game for the challenge.</p>

<p>I’m already 4 days in, and so far it does seem to be a beneficial change.</p>

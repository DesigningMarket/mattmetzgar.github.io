I"H<p>An interesting <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563214005810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> looked at the the frequency of checking email and stress levels.</p>

<p>The control group checked their email at their normal rate, which was about 12 times per day. The experimental group was instructed to check their email only 3 times per day.</p>

<p>The group with limited email checks displayed significantly lower daily stress levels and improved well-being.</p>

<p>There are two other items of interest with this study. First, the experimental group actually checked their email 4.7 times per day on average, exceeding the target of 3 times per day.</p>

<p>Second, even though limiting email reduced stress, participants still <a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2014/12/03/check-less-to-reduce-email-stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> this difficult to do:</p>

<p>“Most participants in our study found it quite difficult to check their email only a few times a day,” says Kushlev. “This is what makes our obvious-in-hindsight findings so striking: People find it difficult to resist the temptation of checking email, and yet resisting this temptation reduces their stress.”</p>

<p>Digital discipline is an important skill than can improve overall health.</p>

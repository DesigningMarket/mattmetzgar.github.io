I"ï<p>The market for information is currently broken. A handful of people in San Francisco determine whether millions of people view certain content or not.</p>

<p>One alternative to this is to use <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IndieWeb</a> principles. The main idea is to post at your own site (like Iâ€™m doing here), and then broadcast out to other services if you wish.</p>

<p>This way you own and control your content instead of corporations.</p>

I"˘<p>Clarence Bass had a great <a href="https://www.cbass.com/Faq(8).htm#Even" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> this month on why New Year‚Äôs resolutions usually fail.</p>

<p>He discusses how people often rely on willpower to stop bad habits. The results are typically poor.</p>

<p>Instead, Bass recommends to forget about bad habits and focus on positive actions instead:</p>

<p>‚ÄúBetter yet, focus on positive action. Forget what not to do. Focus on what you can do.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt waste precious willpower worrying about your bad habits. Focus on realistic positive steps on the way to achieving your goals.‚Äù</p>

<p>The same idea holds true for those wanting to reduce screen time. Instead of focusing on restricting screen time, focus on replacing it with healthier offline activities.</p>

<p>Hobbies such as music and art have a long track <a href="https://mattmetzgar.com/time-use-before-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record</a> of improving well-being.</p>

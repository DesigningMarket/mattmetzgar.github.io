I"2<p>What if a cheap supplement could help protect you from COVID-19? Vitamin D may very well improve outcomes associated with COVID-19.</p>

<p>There have been a number of studies showing a link between Vitamin D and COVID-19. For example, this <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146028/">study</a> shows how low Vitamin D levels are associated with increased COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality.</p>

<p>In terms of cause-and-effect, this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/pdf/main.pdf">study</a> showed positive results from Vitamin D supplementation. This <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.16.20232397v1">study</a> showed no effect. Other, larger randomized studies are underway.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some government bodies are taking a wait-and-see approach, citing there is “<a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/942809">insufficient evidence</a>” for Vitamin D supplementation at the present time.</p>

<p>Why, in the midst of a pandemic, would anyone want to wait for that evidence given that Vitamin D is an extremely safe supplement? There is a high potential upside with virtually no risk.</p>

<p>This idea was recently <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.201912">summarized</a> by a group of researchers:</p>

<p>“There seems nothing to lose and potentially much to gain by recommending vitamin D supplementation for all, e.g. at 800–1000 IU/day, making it clear that this is to help ensure immune health and not solely for bone and muscle health.”</p>

<p>Personally, I take 4,000 IU of Vitamin D per day (this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Carlson-Immune-Health-Strength-Unflavored/dp/B06XSKFSVV/">brand</a>). More information about Vitamin D is available <a href="https://www.vitamindsociety.org/">here</a>.</p>

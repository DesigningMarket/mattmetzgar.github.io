Screen time has exploded during COVID-19. Children are moving less and staring at screens more (for both school and leisure). From this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190470/pdf/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, here is data on Chinese adolescents:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Simply put, most children are not getting sufficient physical activity every day.

Limiting screen time <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30199286/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leads</a> to increased physical activity.

Screen time limits can improve overall health for both children and adults.
